#Inferences:-
#Mean and median age: 22 years

#Age range: 20â€“24 years, all young adults

#4 females, 2 males

#All physical note-takers are female

#Even split between graduate and undergraduate students (3 each)

#5 participants are from Computer Science, 1 from Medicine

#4 participants prefer digital note-taking, 2 prefer physical

#3 participants take notes weekly, 2 daily, 1 occasionally

#Digital note-taking is preferred for ease of use (2), organization (2), and convenience (1)

#Physical note-taking is preferred for cognitive retention (1)

#All male participants prefer digital note-taking

#Physical note-takers are slightly younger (average age 21) compared to digital users (average age 22.5)

#Preference patterns appear linked to gender, field of study, and perceived functional benefit
